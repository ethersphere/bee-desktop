### Architecture

Swarm Desktop consists of 3 components:

 1. Electron back-end that provides orchestration API that retrieve, spins, stops and manage the Bee node
 2. Installer front-end that provides UI that walk user through installation of all the components
 3. Bundled [Bee Dashboard](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard) that provides UI to manage Bee node and provides access to Swarm network

The Electron back-end is placed in `src` folder and the Installer is placed in `installer` folder.

The Bee Desktop stores logs of both itself and Bee in the application's logs folder:

 - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Swarm Desktop/`
 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Swarm Desktop\Log\` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Swarm Desktop\Log\`)
 - Linux: `~/.local/state/Swarm Desktop/`

It also stores configuration files, Bee assets and other things in application's data folder:

 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Swarm Desktop\Data` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Swarm Desktop\Data`)
 - Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Swarm Desktop`
 - Linux: `~/.local/share/Swarm Desktop` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Swarm Desktop`)

### Development

As there are several independent components it bit depends on what you want to develop.

**Be aware!** The UIs (Installer and Dashboard) won't automatically open during development in order not to confuse on which
environment they are running. You have to open them manually.

#### Electron Desktop

To work on the Electron Desktop back-end you just need to do your work and then run `npm start`. This will launch the
Electron app and shows the Tray icon. No UI will be opened automatically. If you need to make more adjustment you have to exit
the process with `SIGINT (CTRL+C)` and relaunch.

#### Installer

To work on the Installer, run first `npm start` that will spin up the Electron Desktop back-end and also launches the `/installer` development
server. In order for the UI to be able to access the Desktop API it needs to have injected API token, which you can do by running `npm run open:installer`
that will open the Installer UI served by the development server with API key be passed in the URL. Changes to the Installer UI are automatically
hot-reloaded.

The UI served by the Desktop itself is updated only when you restart the `npm start`.

#### Dashboard

To work on the Dashboard, run first `npm start` that will spin up the Electron Desktop back-end. Then go to your locally cloned `bee-dashboard` repo and
in it start the development server with `npm start`. Similarly to Installer, the Dashboard also needs to have API key injected in order to use the
Desktop's API. You can inject it similarly by running `npm run desktop` in the Dashboard repo that will open the Dashboard UI with API key in the URL.
Changes to the Installer UI are automatically hot-reloaded.

The UI served by the Desktop itself is updated only when you update the `@ethersphere/bee-dashboard` NPM package in the Desktop repo.

#### Maintenance tasks

There are several handy scripts:

 - `npm run purge:data` that purge's the Desktop's data folder
 - `npm run purge:logs` that purge's the Dekstop's logs folder
